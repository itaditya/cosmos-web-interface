 # Cosmos
 > A central platform to dive into the universe of algorithm and data structures.

 **Cosmos** is your personal online collection of every algorithm and data structure one will ever encounter and use in a lifetime. This provides solutions in a various languages spanning `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `Python`, `Go` and others. 

 This work is maintained by a community of hundreds of people and is a _massive collaborative effort_ to bring the readily available coding knowledge **online**.
